## Planned Obsolescence
I'd expect that most people reading this blog are aware that we are in an era of "planned obsolescence". But in case you haven't come across this term before, it simply means that companies *design* their products to degrade after a certain amount of time. This helps guarantee that customers will always come back for an upgrade. Apple is known as the worst offender in this regard, and I will use their products as examples here. But while Apple pioneered the concept, all other companies followed suit.

In my conversations with friends and co-workers – all of whom are fairly technical people – about how planned obsolescence is realized, they typically mention the likes of "glass backs crack easily," "batteries and screens are hard to replace," and "they slow down your phone as the battery gets older". These practices do indeed contribute to planned obsolescence, but they do serve some purpose.

Glass backs fell out of favor in 2012 when the aluminum-backed iPhone 5 was released. Aluminum backs remained until the iPhone 8 and X were released in 2017, and the reason glass backs returned was to allow for wireless charging. It is certainly debatable how much the consumer benefits from this compromise between durability and convenience, but the point is that there is some functional purpose to glass backs.

Then there's the fact that batteries and screens are glued down to the core of the earth. There is no justification for batteries, but by now, most companies have made them easier to remove. On the other hand, the screen needs to be strongly glued down to provide the water resistance we take for granted. People seem to have forgotten the days of "I dropped my phone in the toilet and it doesn't work anymore, but I'm going to take it to the Apple store and pretend that the rain last week (that I totally made up because we're in a drought) magically got in it and it's not my fault". To be fair, screens were unnecessarily difficult to remove even before water resistance was introduced with the iPhone 7 of 2016.

And there's the fact that Apple was caught slowing down people's phones through software updates. This obviously made them tons of money, and they should have always been honest with their customers about this. But the feature does need to exist in some fashion. This is because as the battery ages, its voltage drops more quickly and unpredictably when it is at low charge. A sudden demand for processing power on a device with an aging battery at low charge could cause the device to suddenly shut down, perhaps even in an undefined logic state. Software protections against this are necessary, and any good engineer would implement them.

Do you notice a pattern? All of these practices are pretty upsetting to the consumer, but there is some element of genuine functionality behind them.

With fast charging, this isn't the case.

## What about fast charging?
Fast charging is probably the most egregious (and effective) means of planned obsolescence. But nobody – not even a single electrical engineer I have talked to – is aware of this. People *love* fast charging, and rightfully so. It's no longer the end of the world if you forgot to plug in your phone overnight (or chose not to, because you can't fall asleep without your phone in your hand). But fast charging is *extremely* bad for your battery.

Fast charging damages your battery in two ways: high charge current, and temperature rise.
