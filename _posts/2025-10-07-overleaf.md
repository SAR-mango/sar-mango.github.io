title: Overleaf is a Piece of Garbage
---

Overleaf SUCKS. It compiles slowly, it's super buggy, and it costs too much. It has useless intrusive features. It lacks useful intuitive features.

Use TeXstudio instead. If you need to collaborate, learn to use `git` and get the rest of your team to do the same.
