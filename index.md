## Welcome
Hi! I'm Erk, an Electrical Engineering student at UC Santa Barbara. I made this website because I wanted a common place I could store my work and share it with others. Here you will find my:
- Projects
- Notes for various classes
- Blog posts
- Miscellaneous guides and whatever else doesn't fit in the categories above

## About Me
My dad taught me how to solder when I was three years old, and EE has been my greatest passion ever since. Below are my specific interests within the field of EE. My projects usually end up being some sort of combination of these:
- Power electronics, especially switching devices
- Control systems, especially when applied to aircraft systems (avionics)
- Wireless communications/RF
- Embedded systems

Though I would consider myself pretty decent at low-level software (data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming in C++), I am typically only interested in software when it has a hardware application at hand. However, I occasionally do some pure software stuff when I have a problem I really want to solve, or if I want to play around with something that piqued my interest (see eApprox; link TBA).
