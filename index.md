title: About Me

## Welcome
Hi! I'm Erk â€“ a third-year electrical engineering student at UC Santa Barbara.

For now I'm making occasional blog posts and reference pages. Later I plan to create a set of notes for various classes I have taken. I will also document some of my future projects.

## About Me
Electrical engineering has been a lifelong passion of mine. I've done several projects involving a mix of power electronics and embedded systems, typically applied to RC drones and planes (see [SinESC](https://github.com/SAR-mango/SinESC)).

I'm mostly into hardware, but I also enjoy programming for a direct hardware application. I'm a fan of C/C++; occasionally I create things like [eApprox](https://github.com/SAR-mango/eApprox). I'm also obsessed with writing stuff in [LaTeX](https://github.com/SAR-mango/latex-templates).

I'm from San Diego and have lived in California all my life.

## Research Interests
I'm interested in signal processing applications of mixed-signal circuits, and perhaps also RF. I hope to narrow this down by late 2025.
