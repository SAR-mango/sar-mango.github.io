title: About Me

## Welcome
Hi! I'm Erk – an electrical engineering student at UC Santa Barbara. I made this website because I wanted a place to store my work and share it with others. For now I'm making occasional blog posts and guides/reference pages. Later I plan to create a set of notes for various classes I have taken. I also hope to document some of my future projects.

## About me
Electrical engineering has been a lifelong passion of mine. I've done several projects involving a mix of power electronics and embedded systems, typically applied to RC drones and planes (see [SinESC](https://github.com/SAR-mango/SinESC)). However, I don't restrict interest to one specific part of a system. I am familiar with all levels of the stack.

I'm mostly a hardware person, but I enjoy writing low-level software (C++) with a direct hardware application. Occasionally I enjoy a pure software project as well – see [eApprox](https://github.com/SAR-mango/eApprox).
